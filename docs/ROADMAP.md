# BaseballOS Roadmap

This roadmap records current direction and major historical milestones. It is
planning context, not an authorization to implement new behavior.

## Current Position

BaseballOS is a trust-first bullpen intelligence platform with certified V1 and
V2 recommendation governance, completed V2.5 governance hardening, and V3 Team
Operations Bullpen Readiness approved for constrained controlled rollout and
ready for controlled rollout observation.

Current V3 status:

```text
CERTIFIED_WITH_NON_BLOCKING_OPERATIONAL_GAPS
CONTROLLED_ROLLOUT_APPROVED
READY_FOR_CONTROLLED_ROLLOUT_OBSERVATION
FULL_PRODUCTION_ROLLOUT_NOT_APPROVED
```

## Active Direction

The next platform capability track is V4 Evidence and Explanation. V4 is
now moving from certified internal backend Availability Explanation Integration
into Team Operations Readiness explanation implementation planning. V4 explains
why existing governed states appear without ranking, selecting, predicting,
recommending, or automating a decision. V4 Phase 10 defines the technical
architecture for future readiness explanations without implementing runtime
behavior.

Recommended next milestone:

```text
V4 Phase 11 - Team Operations Readiness Explanation Implementation
```

The next V4 milestone should implement only an internal backend readiness
explanation adapter and focused tests. It should not expose API routes, modify
Dashboard UI, change readiness calculations, change Recommendation Engine
behavior, approve certification, or approve rollout.

## Product Tracks

| Track | Current state | Next decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bullpen Intelligence | Complete production foundation | Continue reliability and evidence retention |
| Fatigue Engine | Complete deterministic workload heuristic | Preserve transparency and avoid prediction claims |
| Availability Engine V1 | Complete | Maintain threshold governance |
| Recommendation Engine V1 | Certified / production ready | Preserve candidate-only scope |
| Recommendation Engine V2 | Certified / production rollout approved | Preserve no-ranking and no-selection boundaries |
| Team Operations Bullpen Readiness | Certified with non-blocking gaps / controlled rollout approved | Observe controlled rollout before full rollout planning |
| V4 Evidence and Explanation Layer | Availability explanations certified; Team Operations readiness explanation architecture complete / planning only | Implement internal backend readiness explanation adapter only |
| Prospect Pipeline | Prototype | Keep prototype until ownership, data, runbook, and evidence gaps close |

## Near-Term Roadmap

1. V4 Phase 11 Team Operations readiness explanation implementation.
2. Controlled rollout monitoring artifact retention for V3 readiness.
3. Post-rollout issue triage if any governance, trust, freshness, refusal, or
   accessibility issue appears.
4. Separate full production rollout decision only if controlled rollout
   evidence supports it.
5. V4 route or UI work only after architecture, backend contracts, tests, and
   certification gates are established for the relevant explanation surface.

## Candidate Future Tracks

These are candidates, not commitments:

- Team Operations Bullpen Readiness full rollout planning.
- V4 Evidence and Explanation route, frontend, certification, and rollout work
  after internal readiness explanation implementation, certification planning,
  API contract planning, and separate authorization.
- Team-level operations intelligence beyond bullpen readiness.
- Prospect Pipeline evidence backfill and potential promotion review.
- Role-aware fatigue distinctions for starters and relievers.
- Reports, exports, and a documented API platform.
- Real minor-league prospect ingestion with a defensible source and lifecycle
  evidence packet.

## Governance Boundaries

Future roadmap work must preserve:

```text
ranking_applied === false
selection_made === false
```

Future roadmap work must not introduce:

- ranking behavior
- selection behavior
- prediction behavior
- best/preferred/recommended behavior
- hidden priority ordering
- pitcher-level advice
- matchup advice

Any future surface that changes lifecycle tier, certification state, rollout
state, data trust assumptions, or user-facing decision language must pass the
governance and lifecycle evidence process linked from
[docs/INDEX.md](INDEX.md).

## Historical Milestone Summary

- V1 completed candidate-level recommendation certification.
- V2 implemented and certified governed bullpen-state intelligence.
- V2.5 completed lifecycle governance hardening, evidence packets, citation
  maps, ownership assignment, retention cadence, and closeout.
- V3 selected Team Operations Bullpen Readiness as the next product direction,
  implemented backend, route, client, and dashboard UI surfaces, completed
  formal certification review, remediated deployment configuration blockers,
  retained manual evidence, approved constrained controlled rollout, and
  reached controlled rollout observation readiness.
- V4 Phase 1 defined the Evidence and Explanation capability as an
  explanation-only layer for existing governed states.
- V4 Phase 2 defined architecture, explanation scopes, proposed object shapes,
  evidence item model, reason code model, governance contract, API candidates,
  frontend candidates, certification requirements, and readiness for Phase 3
  implementation planning.
- V4 Phase 3 defined the implementation roadmap, backend plan, frontend plan,
  contract plan, testing strategy, certification strategy, rollout strategy,
  documentation requirements, and readiness for Phase 4 backend domain
  foundation.
- V4 Phase 4 implemented the internal backend domain foundation, including
  explanation objects, evidence items, reason codes, limitation types,
  governance payloads, validation helpers, deterministic serialization, and
  focused backend tests.
- V4 Phase 5 implemented deterministic explanation builders, evidence helpers,
  limitation helpers, reason helpers, governance defaults, stable generated IDs,
  serialization support, and focused backend tests.
- V4 Phase 6 implemented an internal availability explanation adapter that maps
  existing Availability Engine outputs into governed V4 explanations without
  changing status assignment, API routes, frontend UI, or dashboard behavior.
- V4 Phase 7 completed certification-readiness review for availability
  explanations, with PASS decisions for coverage, evidence attribution,
  limitation handling, governance, determinism, testing, and engine
  preservation, and a PARTIAL reason-mapping observation for conservative
  positive Available-state reason granularity.
- V4 Phase 8 certified internal backend Availability Explanation Integration
  with non-blocking observations, preserving the explanation-only scope and
  leaving API, frontend, dashboard, rollout, and additional explanation
  categories for future phases.
- V4 Phase 9 defined the Team Operations Readiness explanation capability,
  including user questions, allowed and prohibited outputs, candidate scopes,
  evidence sources, reason codes, limitation model, governance definition,
  certification requirements, and readiness for Phase 10 architecture.
- V4 Phase 10 defined the Team Operations Readiness explanation architecture,
  including systems boundaries, scope architecture, evidence mapping, reason
  code strategy, limitation strategy, builder integration, object shapes,
  testing architecture, certification architecture, and readiness for Phase 11
  implementation.
